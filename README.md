<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**R Programming Challenge** was conceived as a rigorous collaborative initiative between [**Amey Thakur**](https://github.com/Amey-Thakur) and [**Mega Satish**](https://github.com/msatmod). Driven by a shared objective to master the R language, this project represents the culmination of a disciplined 30-day coding journey. Through mutual dedication and daily practice, we successfully navigated the curriculum, from foundational logic to advanced automation, earning recognized certifications as a testament to this scholarly effort.

The project demonstrates a disciplined approach to upskilling in Data Science, leveraging the **R Ecosystem** (RStudio, Tidyverse, ggplot2) to solve real-world analytical problems.

### Learning Objectives
The curriculum is governed by strict **computational data science principles**:
*   **Statistical Fluency**: Mastering R's core statistical engine for regression, clustering, and time-series analysis.
*   **Data Wrangling**: Utilizing `dplyr` and vectors for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
*   **Automated Collection**: Implementing robust web scrapers to gather unstructured data from the web.

> [!TIP]
> **Challenge Completion**
>
> This repository represents the successful completion of a rigorous **30-Day Coding Challenge**. Challenge successfully completed with [**Mega Satish**](https://github.com/msatmod/R). Each directory corresponds to specific daily milestones, ensuring a linear and verifiable progression of skills.

<!-- QUICK START -->
<a name="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **R Language (4.0+)**: Core runtime environment. [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- **RStudio IDE**: Premier integrated development environment. [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

> [!WARNING]
> **Runtime Environment Guard**
>
> R scripts are sensitive to directory pathing. Ensure you set your working directory to the **source file location** (`Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location`) before execution to prevent `file-not-found` errors during data loading phases.

### 2. Installation & Setup

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/R.git
cd R
```

#### Step 2: Library Synchronization
Ensure all required CRAN libraries are installed. Open RStudio and run:
```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "rvest", "dplyr", "httr"))
```

### 3. Execution
Navigate to any specific day directory (e.g., `Web Scraping in R`) and execute the `.R` scripts directly within the RStudio console.
