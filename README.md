<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**R Programming Challenge** is a structured academic initiative designed to master the R language through a rigid 30-day coding regimen. This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of the learning path, starting from foundational semantics and progressing to complex data manipulation, statistical modeling, and automated web scraping.

The project demonstrates a disciplined approach to upskilling in Data Science, leveraging the **R Ecosystem** (RStudio, Tidyverse, ggplot2) to solve real-world analytical problems.

### Learning Objectives
The curriculum is governed by strict **computational data science principles**:
*   **Statistical Fluency**: Mastering R's core statistical engine for regression, clustering, and time-series analysis.
*   **Data Wrangling**: Utilizing `dplyr` and vectors for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
*   **Automated Collection**: Implementing robust web scrapers to gather unstructured data from the web.

> [!TIP]
> **Challenge Completion**
>
> This repository represents the successful completion of a rigorous **30-Day Coding Challenge**. Each directory corresponds to specific daily milestones, ensuring a linear and verifiable progression of skills.
